Introduction
============

Cardinal Suite provides a selection of tracing / debugging features normally used from command line. The aim is to alleviate the tedium
of manually ssh:ing to the device and doing these error-prone steps by hand. It also provides various convenience features like
drag-and-drop package installation / file transfer.

Cardinal Suite is mostly targeted at intermediate/advanced users. It does not offer features already supported by Qt Creator 
(builds, single step debugging).

Installation
============

Ubuntu:

Add Forum Nokia PPA and do 

apt-get install cardinalsuite.

Others:

Acquire the source code and run directly.

Dependencies: 

On host: Python 2.x, Paramiko, PyQt4.
On device: sshd, python, tools you want to use (strace, ltrace, sp-rtrace, valgrind, gdb...)

Device setup
============

Before the suite can be useful, you need to set up ssh networking and automatic authentication on the device. This is accomplished by copying your 
RSA public keys to the device, following these steps:

- Set up networking on the device. This may mean connecting an USB cable and ensuring that you get an ip address (with "SDK Connectivity" / "MAD Developer"), 
or connecting to WLAN. Ensure you can ssh in as "root".

- Edit the file ~/.cardinal.ini and add details (ip address and default user) for the device, and set "defaultdevice" to point at this device. Like this::

    [n900_usb]
    host = 192.168.2.15
    user = user 
    
    [main] 
    defaultdevice = n900_usb


This is the file you need to edit when switching to a different device.

- Launch "cardinalsetup" from terminal. Type in the ip address as prompted, and let cardinalsetup generate the rsa key if one doesn't already exist.

- You should be all set.
