Introduction
============

Cardinal Suite provides a selection of tracing / debugging features normally used from command line. The aim is to alleviate the tedium
of manually ssh:ing to the device and doing these error-prone steps by hand. It also provides various convenience features like
drag-and-drop package installation / file transfer.

Cardinal Suite is mostly targeted at intermediate/advanced users.

Why Cardinal Suite?
===================

You may be wondering why "yet another" tool needs to exist in addition to the ones already out there.

Compared to **command line**

* CS avoids the tedium of opening ssh sessions, remembering & copy-pashing cryptic 
  commands, manually copying logfiles and installers around, and generally easing the
  learning curve for the tools in the first place.
* Cardinal Suite does not try to cover for the fact that it's a front end for command line
  tools - on the contrary, you can think of it as fun way to learn about the
  avalable tools. 

* Getting a new ssh root session without password entry is one click away in CS.

Compared to **Qt SDK**

* CS provides tons of tools that are just not available in the SDK (and are not likely 
  to be there in the immediate future, due to their somewhat "advanced" nature). 
  
* CS is also handy if you are using Remote Compiler - when you get the .deb from the 
  remote compiler, just drag it Beamer to get it installed without having to touch the
  device (wait for app manager, set up bluetooth, etc).

* If you have a crashing application, it's much faster to see where it's crashing by
  using CS's core analysis feature, instead of setting up a proper debugging session with
  Qt SDK, launching the app in debugger and waiting for it to crash.

* If there is an obscure tool that is missing, it can be added with a light process.
  CS is written in Python and PyQt, and is not an officially supported product, so
  it's easy to add features without bureacratic concerns (legal checks, code reviews..).

Installation
============

Ubuntu:

Add Forum Nokia PPA and do::

    apt-get install cardinalsuite.

Others:

Acquire the source code and run directly.

Dependencies: 

On host: Python 2.x, Paramiko, PyQt4.
On device: sshd, python, tools you want to use (strace, ltrace, sp-rtrace, valgrind, gdb...)

Device setup
============

Before the suite can be useful, you need to set up ssh networking and automatic authentication on the device. This is accomplished by copying your 
RSA public keys to the device, following these steps:

- Set up networking on the device. This may mean connecting an USB cable and ensuring that you get an ip address (with "SDK Connectivity" / "MAD Developer"), 
  or connecting to WLAN. Ensure you can ssh in as "root".

- Edit the file ~/.cardinal.ini and add details (ip address and default user) for the device, and set "defaultdevice" to point at this device. Like this::

    [n900_usb]
    host = 192.168.2.15
    user = user 
    
    [main] 
    defaultdevice = n900_usb


This is the file you need to edit when switching to a different device.

- Launch "cardinalsetup" from terminal. Type in the ip address as prompted, and let cardinalsetup generate the rsa key if one doesn't already exist.

- You should be all set.

Common tasks
============



Install packages on Device
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Launch "Beamer"

.. image:: pics/beamer.png


Drag files (.deb / .rpm) to the Beamer window, accept the prompt about installing them. If the package is on the web (e.g. as a link in OBS repository view), 
you can drag the url here - CS will automatically download it on the host from you, and deploy on the device.

Analyze memory use of the apps on device
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Launch "sp-smaps"
- Browse the produced html report, pay attention to "shared dirty" field

Analyze memory use of an application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Use sp-rtrace or valgrind tools.
- **Caution**: large frameworks like Qt often report false positives as leaks - i.e. memory blocs that are allocated, but 
  never intended to be freed before process exit. Therefore, you need to excercise common sense to determine whether 
  there is a real leak behind the reported allocation.

Launch an application
+++++++++++++++++++++

Enter the app name in the "Exec" field. Click "Find" to search for the application binary (this looks through PATH, .desktop files...)

Start tracing when application is already running
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Many commands allow operation in "deferred" mode. This means that you launch the application normally, but only enable tracing later on when the application is already running (think "strace -p PID").

To do this, check "Defer" checkbox before choosing the operation. Later, in Process Explorer, press "Start tracing" to start tracing, and the same button to stop tracing later on.

Commands that support Deferred mode include strace, sp-trace, ltrace.

Examine crash reperts
+++++++++++++++++++++

- Do "File => Collect Cores" to start collecting core dumps (you need to do this after every reboot)
- Launch an app with "Run".
- If/when the app crashes, choose "Examine cores" and select the core file you want to investigate
- Note that this is sometimes handy even if you prefer to debug with Qt SDK - only doing post-mortem crash 
  analysis on device can be much faster as no debugger needs to be used before the actual crash.
- You do need to ensure that all the necessary -dbg packages are installed to gleam useful information
  about the cores

Browse / modify device file system
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- You can easily send files to the device using "Beamer". All the files end up in ~/cardinal/inbox".
- You can export files with Beamer also - copy the files to the "~/cardinal/outbox" 
  directory on device, then choose "Fetch outbox" from Beamer
- Choose "Krusader" to launch Krusader, with the device content opened in right hand panel
- Choose "Mount" to mount the device file system under ~/.gvfs.

Tracing an application
======================

"Process Explorer" is the window that gets opened when you launch an application (with run/strace/...). It can be used to interact with the application (send signal, start / stop tracing) or look at the logs that the application is producing.

Every log emitted by the application is presented by a tab in Process Explorer. Press **"R"** to fetch the latest version of the currently active log. Press "**Scn**" to scan for possible new logs from the application (e.g. after postprocessing sp-rtrace output, you can look for rtrace_resolved.txt).

If you were running an operation that requires post-processing to produce useful results (like sp-trace), press "Postproc" and select appropriate postprocessing mode. sp-trace, for example, allows you to filter out memory allocations that were subsequently freed, showing only a list of allocations it considers to be leaks.

Profiling the system
====================

Cardinal Suite supports "oprofile", a statistic profiler for Linux systems. Statistic profiling is convenient because it doesn't hurt performance badly.

To get started, you need to prepare the device for oprofile usage. This includes loading the oprofile kernel module. To do this, select 
File => Prepare device => OProfile init. After this, click "Oprofile" and use Start / Stop / Reset as appropriate.

You can invoke "opreport" with custom flags, example can be discovered behind the combobox. Install oprofile on your desktop and 
run "man opreport" for guidance, or see http://wiki.maemo.org/Documentation/devtools/maemo5/oprofile

FAQ
====



Does CS work on windows
+++++++++++++++++++++++

CS is only using cross platform libraries, but it requires functional installation of ssh and related tools. 
As it stands, it's entirely untested on windows.
